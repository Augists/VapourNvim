## Introduction

The goal of this project is to simply *get work done* quickly.

This project is built to be:
* **Functional**. The core of an ideal IDE is functionality. It will *not* be compromised for minimalism
* **Minimal**. Too many plugins can affect startup time. Time is not to be wasted for opening files and loading plugins!

## Features

* A very elegant and clean look to the editor
* An extensible package management system
* Written in an efficient programming language
* Great support for version control
* Code completion
* Language support(LSP)

* Faster navigation with telescope and hop.nvim
* Better syntax highlighting with treesitter
* Terminal integration so that you don't need to hop between different tabs or windows
